				<p>my name is emily lobel! i am a rising junior at Bryn Mawr College double majoring in computer science and theater!</p>
				<p id = "littleguy">(i don't currently intend to join the two - i haven't seen a play written in java or a website that sings yet - but i love both very much, and i hope to see more intersection between the two worlds!)</p>
				<p>i've been a dedicated employee to Girls Who Code for the last three summers. women's empowerment is a subject close to my heart, as well as the empowerment of all people. i hope these subjects are important to you too.</p>
				<p>i'm currently pursuing internships for the summer of 2019. i have in-class experience in java, python, C, and C++.  i'm also super interested in front-end and design, so i'm doing my best to self-teach! if you have any advice, let me know. :)</p>
                <p>i love to meet new people and share experiences! talking about any of the above topics with you would be super awesome. seriously! as for non-CS discussion topics, my favorites are musical theater, video games, the beatles, and SNL, but email me and we can talk about anything you want!!! </p>
