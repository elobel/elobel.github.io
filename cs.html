				<p>hi! again, i'm emily lobel. i am a senior at Bryn Mawr College double majoring in computer science and theater! i'm so lucky to be studying my two greatest passions. &#9734;</p>
				<p>in summer 2019, i was a <a href = 'https://hackny.org/' target = "_blank">hackNY fellow</a> and a software engineering intern at <a href='https://www.buzzfeed.com/'>BuzzFeed</a>. the next time you see any changes in that white navigation bar at the top of BuzzFeed.com, that'll be thanks to the internal tool i helped build! before 2019, i was a dedicated intern and classroom T.A. to <a href='https://girlswhocode.com/'>Girls Who Code</a> for three years. </p>
				<p>as i graduate in may 2020, i'm excited to be pursuing full time positions. i have professional experience in front-end development with React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. i have academic experience in Java, Python, C, and C++. i'm always eager to learn more about computer science! if you have any insight about what i should learn next, let me know. :)</p>
                <p>i love to meet new people and share experiences -- please reach out to me about anything above! as for non-CS discussion topics, my favorites are musical theater, video games, the beatles, and SNL, but email me and we can talk about anything you want!!! </p>
