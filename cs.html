				<p>hi! again, i'm emily lobel. i am a junior at Bryn Mawr College double majoring in computer science and theater! i'm so lucky to be studying my two greatest passions. &#9734;</p>
				<p>i discovered coding right before college and have been doing it ever since. i've learned a lot, and want to do all i can to keep learning more! as for work experience, i'm currently a hackNY fellow and software engineering intern at BuzzFeed. previously, i was a dedicated employee to Girls Who Code for three summers.</p>
				<p>as i graduate in may 2020, i'm excited to soon pursue full time positions. i have professional experience in front-end development. i have academic experience in java, python, C, and C++. i'm always eager to learn more about computer science! if you have any insight about what i should learn next, let me know. :)</p>
                <p>i love to meet new people and share experiences -- please reach out to me about anything above! as for non-CS discussion topics, my favorites are musical theater, video games, the beatles, and SNL, but email me and we can talk about anything you want!!! </p>
