				<p>hi! again, i'm emily lobel. i am a junior at Bryn Mawr College double majoring in computer science and theater! i'm so lucky to be studying my two greatest passions. &#9734;</p> 
				<p>i grew up in new york city and was raised by theater-loving parents. (thanks, mom and dad!) i've been formally studying theater for 12 years. i got my start with the Lee Strasberg Theater and Film Institute, then later attended pre-college programs at Carnegie Mellon and Northwestern Universities. this past summer, i became a student at Upright Citizens Brigade.</p>
				<p>at Bryn Mawr, i have been seen as #14 in The Wolves, Sally in You're A Good Man Charlie Brown, Khlestakov in The Government Inspector, and Ismene in Riot Antigone with both the theater department's mainstage productions and Greasepaint musical theater club. i also am president of the Extreme Keys A Cappella group.</p>
                <p>i am always looking for theater work AND new theater friends! please reach out to me about anything at all. i'd love to talk about theater... or some of my other favorite topics: computer science, SNL, the beatles, and video games!!! :)  </p>
